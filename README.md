# Rails-Project

## Project Description

To create a new Rails app that has at least 1 model, `User`, with Full CRUD capabilities with the following fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `city`, `state`, and `score`. Score should be a numeric field, and not allow letters to be saved. All fields are required. The app will need to display an error message(s) to the user for any missing and/or incorrect fields. The `User` model should have a `full_name` method that returns the user's `first_name` and `last_name`. Will, also, need to incorporate tests for the controller.
